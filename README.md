# Research-on-Dynamic-0-1-Knapsack-Problem-Based-on-Genetic-Algorithms.
The topic of my undergraduate graduation project is Research on Dynamic 0-1 Knapsack Problem Based on Genetic Algorithms.  Three variants of the standard genetic algorithm were studied for solving the dynamic combinatorial optimization problem.
